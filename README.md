# CuriosityPhotos
Simple app that talks to NASA's public API serving photos from the Curiosity Mars rover.  

The project expects a file "apikey.txt", which will appear in red in the File Navigator when you open the project.  Before the app will run you'll need to create this file.  It should contain nothing other than your key, which you can request from http://api.nasa.gov.
